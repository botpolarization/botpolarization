We share the network with 200000 nodes for reference. Other sizes can be generated by running the run_generate.py script with parameters of interest. Naming convention is as follows;
N_Rho_nodes.csv
N_Rho_edges.csv
N_rho.pickle

N is the number of nodes in the generated synthetic network. Rho is the polarization parameter of the generator. We provide the network both in nodes+edges csv format and a networkx object as a pickle dump.
