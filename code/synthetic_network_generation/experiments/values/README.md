Here, we share a sample of results of random removal experiments. Each file is a pickle object and can be loaded as a dictionary. There are two lists in the dictionary rwcs and rwcs_reduced. rwcs list is the RWC distribution of the complete synthetic network. rwcs_reduced is the RWC distribution of the synthetic network with random nodes removed.

Naming convention is as follows;

N_rho_removeratio.pickle

where N is the number of nodes of synthetic network, rho is the polarization parameter of the generator, and removeratio is the ratio of nodes removed from the synthetic network randomly.
